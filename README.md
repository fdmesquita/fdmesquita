<h2>Hello World ðŸ‘‹ <h2>
 
<p>Graphic Designer actually in training at the Wild Code School in full remote and currently on the path of becoming a fullstack javascript web developer in Bordeaux France.</p>
 
<p>After several years spent as a graphic designer in France and Canada and with already some rudiment in HTML and CSS, I decided to go a step further and to become a web developer full stack. I really enjoy learning new things and coding even though quite challenging and sometimes upsetting (looking at you syntax) it is such a joy when you finally find the solution and everything goes finally the way you intend it to be.</p>
 
 <p>
Wild Code School mantra: <br>
  <strong> <i> 'learn how to learn' </i> </strong><br>
 and us Wilders stick to it!
